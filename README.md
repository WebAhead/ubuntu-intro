## What ?

- Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution.
> **What is linux ?**
> Linux is an open-source operating system and a low-cost or free alternative to Microsoft Windows

> **open-source** meaning that everone can view the code of Ubuntu, and anyone can contribute to it's progress.

## Why ?

- It's lightweight and high performant, unlike windows.
- It's free, and it also comes with a massive library of tools that are also free to download.
- Better security and privacy
> Linux ensures the privacy of userâ€™s data as it never collects much data from the user while using its distributions or software but this is not true for many other operating systems.
- Gives you deeper control over you computer, since it's lower level and does not hide things from you. 


## How ?


### Let's install it together :tada: 

Prerequisites:

1) Have a usb with Ubuntu image on it.
2) Make sure to have a computer :laughing: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, and enough storage for atleast 20 GB.
> Make sure to help others if you have finished the setting up/ or already have Ubuntu. :pray: 




### Step 1
Go to ` Control Panel > System and Security > Create and format hard disk partitions`

### Step 2

- Choose which disk you want to partition.
> Partitioning is the process of dividing a disk into one or more regions, the so called partitions. partitioning a hard disk is helpful for either better organization or for having 2 operating systems on the same hard disk. 

- And then shrink the volume (hard disk) to 20 - 40 GB.

- **Make sure to check in with a mentor before moving on to Step 3**.
### Step 3

- Restart your computer and enter the BIOS Setup. **Make sure to have the usb stick in the computer**
     - On every computer the entry to BIOS key is different, so you should go on Google and search how to get in the BIOS for you paticular computer's model. or here's a list for the common BIOS keys for different manufacturers:
  
        - Acer: F2 or DEL
        - ASUS: F2 for all PCs, F2 or DEL for motherboards
        - Dell: F2 or F12
        - HP: ESC or F10
        - Lenovo: F2 or Fn + F2
        - Lenovo (Desktops): F1
        - Lenovo (ThinkPads): Enter + F1.
        - MSI: DEL for motherboards and PCs
        - Microsoft Surface Tablets: Press and hold volume up button.
        - Samsung: F2
        - Sony: F1, F2, or F3
        - Toshiba: F2

> If you are stuck or not sure what to do, ask a fellow a student for help.

- After you enter the BIOS Setup, change the order of the boot so that the usb stick (which is called Ubuntu 19.04 UEFI in the BIOS) is first.
> boot sequence defines which devices a computer should check for the operating system's boot files to run.

- From there you will get a black or purple screen with options to choose from, select the `Install Ubuntu` option.

### Step 4

- Select English.
- Next select the input's (keyboard's) language to be English too.
- On the next step choose Normal installation, and both of the other options.
- In the installation part choose the `Something else` option.
- After choosing `Something else` option and clicking continue, call for a mentor. cause this is a critical part of the installation since you might corrupt your hard disk :sweat_smile:.
